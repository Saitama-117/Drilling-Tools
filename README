Oil and Gas Cutting Tool Web App
================================

This code is submitted to fulfil the Group Report requirements for Increment A2 of the CMM004 Software Engineering Course.
The Cutting Tool web app will allow prospective clients to find suitable Specialist Cutting Tool company services.
The client enters details such as dimensions of the tubular to be cut, well minimum restriction, well bore pressure
and temperature at the cut well depth. The web app will then identify which tool(s), if any, are applicable,
displaying tool 3D CAD models in a form that can be rotated, zoomed etc.

====================================================
IMPORTANT - Automatic Table Creation and Population:
====================================================

Loading index.php WHILE NOT LOGGED IN AS ADMIN will do the following:
1) create the admins, tools, tubulars and cuts tables automatically if they do not already exist
2) populate the above tables with representative data if that data does not already exist
Note: The connection details in the db_connect.php file will have to be updated to match the host MySQL installation.

The default login credentials are 'admin' and 'password'

Once logged in as an admin, the database data can be modified and deleted as required.
Returning the index.php page WHILE LOGGED IN AS ADMIN will not change the stored data.
However, once logged out, returning to the index.php page will add the original data to the database as needed.
