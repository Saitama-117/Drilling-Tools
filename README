Oil and Gas Cutting Tool Web App
================================

This code is submitted to fulfil the Group Report requirements for Increment A2 of the CMM004 Software Engineering Course.
The Cutting Tool web app will allow prospective clients to find suitable Specialist Cutting Tool company services.
The client enters details such as dimensions of the tubular to be cut, well minimum restriction, well bore pressure
and temperature at the cut well depth. The web app will then identify which tool(s), if any, are applicable,
displaying tool 3D CAD models in a form that can be rotated, zoomed etc.

====================================================
IMPORTANT - Automatic Table Creation and Population:
====================================================

Loading index.php WHILE NOT LOGGED IN AS ADMIN will do the following:
1) create the admins, tools, tubulars and cuts tables automatically if they do not already exist
2) populate the above tables with representative data if that data does not already exist

Note:   1) Update database connection details in the db_connect.php file to match the host MySQL installation
        2) Configure php.ini and sendmail.ini files to enable mailService.php to send an email

The default login credentials are 'admin' and 'password'

Once logged in as an admin, the database data can be modified and deleted as required.
Returning the index.php page WHILE LOGGED IN AS ADMIN will not change the stored data.
However, once logged out, returning to the index.php page will add the original data to the database as needed.

Suggest search parameters for the default data set
==================================================

1) Tubular OD 5.5 in, ID 4.56 in, 11.5 ppf
Pressure: 1000 psi, Temperature: 100 degC, minimum restriction: 4.25 in
Returns 2 tools both with CAD models

2) Tubular OD: 6.625 in, ID: 6.135 in, Weight: 17 ppf
Pressure: 5000 psi, Temperature: 150 degC, minimum restriction: 6 in
Returns 2 tools both with CAD models

3) Tubular OD: 7.625 in, ID: 7.125 in, Weight: 20 ppf
Pressure: 2000 psi, Temperature: 50 degC, minimum restriction: 7 in
Returns 2 tools, 1 tool has a CAD model
